# Web-Visualization-Dashboard-Latitude

Web Visualization Dashboard of weather in 500+ cities at different latitudes relative to the equator line. The visualizations show temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap4.

##  <a name="background"></a>Background

Created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past assignment. Specifically, we have plotted weather data.
we have created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contains the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.


## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

The website consist of 7 total pages :
 * A landing page containing:
	An explanation of the project.
	Links to each visualizations page.
 * Four visualization pages, each with:
	1. A descriptive title and heading tag.
 	2. The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
	3. A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
	4. A "Comparisons" page that:
	Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
	Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
	The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.
 * A "Data" page that:
	Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
	The table must be a bootstrap table component.
	The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML. Try using a tool you already know, pandas. Pandas has a nifty method approprately called to_html that allows you to generate a HTML table from a pandas dataframe. See the documentation here
